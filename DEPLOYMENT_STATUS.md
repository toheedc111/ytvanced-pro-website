# üéâ DEPLOYMENT IN PROGRESS

## ‚úÖ What You've Successfully Done
1. **Updated nameservers** to Cloudflare:
   - `lakas.ns.cloudflare.com`
   - `tori.ns.cloudflare.com`
2. **Configured DNS records** in Cloudflare:
   - Root domain CNAME pointing to `cname.vercel-dns.com`
   - WWW subdomain CNAME pointing to `cname.vercel-dns.com`

## üìä Current Status
- **Nameservers**: Still propagating (showing Hostinger nameservers)
- **DNS records**: Not yet active
- **Website**: Not yet accessible at custom domain

## ‚è∞ Timeline
- **Nameserver propagation**: 4-24 hours (currently in progress)
- **DNS record propagation**: 5-15 minutes (after nameservers propagate)
- **SSL certificate**: 10-20 minutes (after DNS records propagate)

## üîß Monitoring Progress
Use these scripts to monitor the deployment:

### 1. Monitor Nameserver Propagation
```bash
./monitor-nameservers.sh
```
This will check every 60 seconds if nameservers have updated to Cloudflare.

### 2. Monitor DNS Record Propagation
```bash
./monitor-dns.sh
```
Run this after nameservers have propagated to check DNS records.

### 3. Check Overall Status
```bash
./status-check.sh
```
This gives a complete status of your deployment.

## ‚úÖ What Happens Next
1. **Nameservers propagate** (4-24 hours):
   - `dig +short NS ytvanced.pro` will show Cloudflare nameservers

2. **DNS records activate** (5-15 minutes after nameserver propagation):
   - `dig +short ytvanced.pro CNAME` will show `cname.vercel-dns.com`
   - `dig +short www.ytvanced.pro CNAME` will show `cname.vercel-dns.com`

3. **Website goes live** (immediately after DNS records activate):
   - https://ytvanced.pro will show your Vercel deployment
   - https://www.ytvanced.pro will redirect to your website

## üìû If You Need Help
If after 24 hours the nameservers haven't propagated:
1. Double-check nameservers in your domain registrar
2. Contact your domain registrar's support
3. Verify Cloudflare DNS records are still correctly configured

## üéØ Success Criteria
When deployment is complete, these commands will show:
```bash
# Nameservers
dig +short NS ytvanced.pro
# Should show:
# lakas.ns.cloudflare.com
# tori.ns.cloudflare.com

# DNS records
dig +short ytvanced.pro CNAME
# Should show: cname.vercel-dns.com

dig +short www.ytvanced.pro CNAME
# Should show: cname.vercel-dns.com

# Website accessibility
curl -I https://ytvanced.pro
# Should show HTTP/2 200
```

Your website deployment is **in progress** and will be complete within 24 hours!
