# üö® CRITICAL: Nameserver Configuration Required

## üîç Current Issue
Your domain `ytvanced.pro` is still using Hostinger's nameservers instead of Cloudflare's nameservers:
- **Current nameservers**: `ns1.dns-parking.com` and `ns2.dns-parking.com`
- **Required nameservers**: Cloudflare's nameservers

## ‚úÖ Solution: Update Nameservers at Your Domain Registrar

### Step 1: Get Your Cloudflare Nameservers
1. Login to Cloudflare dashboard (https://dash.cloudflare.com)
2. Select your `ytvanced.pro` domain
3. Click on the "DNS" tab
4. Scroll down to the "Nameservers" section
5. Note the Cloudflare nameservers (they look like):
   ```
   ns1.cloudflare.com
   ns2.cloudflare.com
   ```
   (Note: Your specific nameservers may be different)

### Step 2: Update Nameservers at Your Domain Registrar
1. Login to your domain registrar's control panel (where you purchased `ytvanced.pro`)
2. Find the DNS or Nameserver settings for your domain
3. Replace the current nameservers with Cloudflare's nameservers:
   ```
   Primary Nameserver: ns1.cloudflare.com (or your specific Cloudflare NS)
   Secondary Nameserver: ns2.cloudflare.com (or your specific Cloudflare NS)
   ```
4. Save the changes

### ‚è∞ Timeline
- Nameserver propagation: 4-24 hours (can be up to 48 hours)
- After nameservers propagate, DNS changes will take effect within 5-15 minutes

### üîß Verification
After updating nameservers, you can verify with:
```bash
dig +short NS ytvanced.pro
```

This should return Cloudflare's nameservers instead of Hostinger's.

## ‚ùì Why This Matters
- **Nameservers** control which DNS provider manages your domain
- **DNS records** (like your CNAME records) only work if the nameservers point to the correct provider
- Currently, your nameservers point to Hostinger, so even your correct Cloudflare DNS records aren't being used

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria
When fixed, these commands should show:
```bash
# Check nameservers
dig +short NS ytvanced.pro
# Should return Cloudflare nameservers like:
# ns1.cloudflare.com
# ns2.cloudflare.com

# Check DNS records (after nameserver propagation)
dig +short ytvanced.pro CNAME
# Should return: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

After nameserver propagation is complete, your website will properly point to your Vercel deployment.
