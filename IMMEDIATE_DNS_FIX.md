# üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: DNS Configuration Fix

## üîç Current Issue
You have an **A record** pointing to `76.76.21.21` instead of a **CNAME record** pointing to Vercel.

## ‚úÖ Required Fix

### Step 1: DELETE the Incorrect A Record
1. Login to Cloudflare dashboard
2. Select ytvanced.pro domain
3. Go to DNS settings
4. **DELETE** this record:
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: ytvanced.pro
   Content: 76.76.21.21
   ```

### Step 2: ADD the Correct CNAME Record
1. In the same DNS settings page, click "Add record"
2. Add this record:
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: @
   Content: cname.vercel-dns.com
   Proxy status: DNS only (gray cloud)
   TTL: Auto
   ```
3. Click "Save"

### Step 3: Verify Existing Records
Make sure you **KEEP** this record:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Content: cname.vercel-dns.com
Proxy status: DNS only
```

## üìã After Making Changes

1. **Clear Cloudflare cache**:
   - Go to "Caching" tab
   - Click "Purge Everything"

2. **Monitor DNS propagation**:
   ```bash
   ./monitor-dns.sh
   ```

3. **Expected timeline**:
   - DNS propagation: 5-15 minutes
   - SSL certificate: 10-20 minutes
   - Full website live: 15-30 minutes

## ‚ùì Why This Matters

- **A records** point to specific IP addresses (76.76.21.21 is not your Vercel deployment)
- **CNAME records** point to hostnames (cname.vercel-dns.com points to your Vercel deployment)
- Vercel requires CNAME records for custom domains to work properly
- Using A records bypasses Vercel's automatic deployment system

## ‚úÖ When Fixed Successfully

Your DNS records should look exactly like this:
```
Type: CNAME | Name: @    | Content: cname.vercel-dns.com | Proxy: DNS only
Type: CNAME | Name: www  | Content: cname.vercel-dns.com | Proxy: DNS only
```

After making these changes, your website will properly point to your Vercel deployment and automatically update with each new deployment.
