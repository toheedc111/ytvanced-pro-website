## 🔍 Google Search Console Setup

The website includes built-in support for Google Search Console verification and automatic updates.

### Verification Methods

1. **Environment Variable (Recommended)**:
   Add your verification code to `.env.production`:
   ```
   VITE_GOOGLE_SEARCH_CONSOLE_VERIFICATION=your_actual_verification_code_here
   ```

2. **Meta Tag Verification** (Already added to index.html):
   ```html
   <meta name="google-site-verification" content="YOUR_GOOGLE_VERIFICATION_CODE_HERE" />
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_VERIFICATION_CODE_HERE` with your actual verification code from Google Search Console.

3. **HTML File Verification**:
   A verification file is available at `public/google1234567890abc.html`. 
   Rename this file to match your verification code and update the content accordingly.

### Automatic Updates

The website includes scripts to automatically update search engines with new content:

1. **Update Script**: `scripts/update-search-console.sh`
   - Updates sitemap dates
   - ⚠ **Note**: Google deprecated sitemap ping in June 2023
   - Pings Bing search console (still supported)

2. **Cron Setup**: `scripts/setup-cron-job.sh`
   - Sets up hourly cron job for automatic updates

3. **Status Checker**: `scripts/check-sitemap-status.sh`
   - Verifies sitemap status and provides recommendations

To set up automatic hourly updates:
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Set up cron job
./scripts/setup-cron-job.sh

# Check sitemap status
./scripts/check-sitemap-status.sh
```

**Important**: Since Google deprecated automatic sitemap notifications, you must manually reload sitemaps in Google Search Console:
1. Visit [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Navigate to "Sitemaps" section
3. Select your sitemap: `https://ytvanced.pro/sitemap.xml`
4. Click "Reload" to force Google to re-read your sitemap

For detailed instructions, see [GOOGLE_SEARCH_CONSOLE.md](GOOGLE_SEARCH_CONSOLE.md)
