# üö® URGENT: DNS Configuration Conflict

## Current Status
Your website **IS accessible** at https://ytvanced.pro, but there's a DNS conflict that needs to be resolved.

## üîç Analysis
- Your website is working (showing content)
- But DNS is still pointing to Hostinger (84.32.84.32)
- This means there might be multiple DNS records conflicting

## ‚úÖ Immediate Fix Required

### Step 1: Check for Duplicate Records in Cloudflare
1. Login to Cloudflare dashboard
2. Go to DNS settings for ytvanced.pro
3. **DELETE ALL** existing A records pointing to 84.32.84.32
4. **DELETE** any CNAME records with name "ytvanced.pro"
5. **KEEP ONLY** these two records:

```
Type: CNAME | Name: @    | Content: cname.vercel-dns.com | Proxy: DNS only
Type: CNAME | Name: www  | Content: cname.vercel-dns.com | Proxy: DNS only
```

### Step 2: Clear Cloudflare Cache
1. In Cloudflare dashboard, go to "Caching" 
2. Click "Purge Everything"
3. Confirm purge

### Step 3: Monitor Changes
Run this command to monitor:
```bash
./monitor-dns.sh
```

## ‚è∞ Important Timeline
- DNS changes: 5-15 minutes
- SSL certificate: 10-20 minutes
- Full propagation: Up to 48 hours (but usually much faster)

## ‚ùì Why This Matters
Having conflicting DNS records can cause:
- Intermittent website availability
- SSL certificate issues
- Search engine indexing problems
- Email delivery issues (if you have email on this domain)

Complete these steps immediately to ensure stable website performance.
